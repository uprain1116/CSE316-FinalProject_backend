# CSE316-FinalProject_backend

The Project was completed as an assignment in CSE316 in Spring 2022.
This repository contains the back-end code. If you are running it on local, please run the front-end code after to see visual results of the project.

### specific instructions
Please go to the **server** folder and install all necessary node_modules using `npm install`.
In the same folder you then can use `node app.js` to start the server that runs the code. The code will run on port 8080 (unless your computer is using that port).

### npm
The following lists are some npm scripts that you will need to use to make the web function.
The instructions are copied from the README.md file inside my-app.

##### `npm install`
This command installs a package and any packages that it depends on.

Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder.
In global mode (ie, with -g or --global appended to the command), it installs the current package context (ie, the current working directory) as a global package.

By default, npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json.
